## Introduction
This exercise aims to guide you through the process of feature extraction and selection using Python. By the end of this exercise, you will have a solid understanding of how to preprocess data, extract meaningful features, and select the most relevant features for your machine learning models.

## Setup
1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
2. **Install Required Libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

## Data Preprocessing
- Load your dataset using `pandas`.
- Handle missing values, if any.
- Normalize or standardize your data as needed.

## Feature Extraction
- Use techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Feature Engineering to extract features from your dataset.

## Feature Selection
- Apply feature selection techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or SelectKBest to choose the most relevant features.

## Conclusion
Summarize what you have learned from this exercise and how it can be applied to real-world datasets.
